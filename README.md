# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Yulin, a curious full stack engineer

I'm passionate about combining human-centered design and the right tech to achieve greater productivity. 

Right now, I'm a senior software developer working in the financial services industry. I built .net web apps to help others make better data driven investment decisions. My latest projects are focusing on designing Dev team workflows and automation pipelines.
